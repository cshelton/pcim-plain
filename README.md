An implementation of PCIMs and C-PCIMs

PCIMs are described in
Asela Gunawardana, Christopher Meek, and Puyang Xu.
A Model for Temporal Dependencies in Event Streams
NIPS 2011.
https://papers.nips.cc/paper/4395-a-model-for-temporal-dependencies-in-event-streams.pdf

and
C-PCIMs are described in
Ankur P. Parikh, Asela Gunawardana, and Christopher Meek
Conjoint Modeling of Temporal Dependencies in Event Streams
UAI Bayesian Modelling Applications Workshop, 2012.

Implementation by Christian Shelton.

This implementation has been extended and used for many research projects
in R-LAIR (http://rlair.cs.ucr.edu/).  What is presented here is a version that has been stripped back to the base models in the above two papers.

If you use this software, or extend it, please

1. Cite the above papers.  Those authors deserve the credit for developing the models (that's the hard part).
2. Mention this repository.
3. Tell me about it (cshelton@cs.ucr.edu)
